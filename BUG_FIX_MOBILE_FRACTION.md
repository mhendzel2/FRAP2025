# Bug Fix: Mobile Fraction Exceeding 100%

## Date: October 18, 2025
## Status: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

Users reported nonsensical mobile fraction values **greater than 100%** (e.g., 112%, 135%) in the FRAP analysis results. This is physically impossible since mobile fraction represents the percentage of fluorescence that recovers.

### Example Issue
```
Mobile Fraction: 112.3%  ← IMPOSSIBLE!
Immobile Fraction: -12.3%  ← NEGATIVE!
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `extract_clustering_features()` method in `frap_core.py`. 

### Background: FRAP Model Equations

For a **single-component** model:
```
I(t) = A * (1 - exp(-k*t)) + C
```

Where:
- **C**: Intensity immediately after bleaching (baseline)
- **A**: Amplitude of recovery (increase from baseline to plateau)
- **Endpoint/Plateau**: `A + C` (final recovered intensity)

For normalized data (pre-bleach = 1.0):
- Mobile fraction = Final plateau intensity = `A + C`
- Since pre-bleach is 1.0, mobile fraction should be ≤ 1.0 (or ≤ 100%)

### What Was Wrong

The code correctly calculated `endpoint = A + C` and `mobile_fraction = endpoint * 100`, BUT:

**The Problem:** Due to fitting instabilities, noise, or re-normalization issues in `load_file()` (line 549), the fitted endpoint could exceed 1.0, resulting in mobile fractions > 100%.

```python
# OLD CODE (lines 933-937)
A, k, C = params
endpoint = A + C
features.update({
    'mobile_fraction': endpoint * 100,  # ← Could be > 100!
    ...
})
```

### Why This Happened

1. **Fitting Instabilities**: Curve fitting algorithms can produce parameters that extrapolate beyond physical limits
2. **Re-normalization in load_file()**: Lines 541-549 re-normalize if pre-bleach isn't exactly 1.0, which can introduce errors
3. **Noise**: Fluorescence noise can cause fitted curves to overshoot
4. **No Bounds Checking**: The code never validated that mobile fraction ≤ 100%

## Solution: Clamp Mobile Fraction to 100%

Added explicit clamping to ensure mobile fraction never exceeds 100% (the physical maximum).

### Single-Component Model Fix

```python
# NEW CODE (lines 933-940)
if model == 'single' and len(params) >= 3:
    A, k, C = params
    endpoint = A + C
    # Mobile fraction is the endpoint (final plateau) in a normalized curve
    # Clamp to 100% maximum to prevent nonsensical values from fitting instabilities
    mobile_fraction = min(endpoint * 100, 100.0) if np.isfinite(endpoint) else np.nan
    features.update({
        'mobile_fraction': mobile_fraction,  # ← Now clamped to ≤ 100%
        ...
    })
```

### Double-Component Model Fix

```python
# NEW CODE (lines 948-961)
elif model == 'double' and len(params) >= 5:
    A1, k1, A2, k2, C = params
    total_amp = A1 + A2
    endpoint = total_amp + C
    
    # Mobile fraction is the endpoint (final plateau) in a normalized curve
    # Clamp to 100% maximum to prevent nonsensical values from fitting instabilities
    mobile_fraction = min(endpoint * 100, 100.0) if np.isfinite(endpoint) else np.nan
    
    features.update({
        'mobile_fraction': mobile_fraction,  # ← Now clamped to ≤ 100%
        ...
    })
```

### Triple-Component Model Fix

```python
# NEW CODE (lines 973-990)
elif model == 'triple' and len(params) >= 7:
    A1, k1, A2, k2, A3, k3, C = params
    total_amp = A1 + A2 + A3
    endpoint = total_amp + C
    
    # Mobile fraction is the endpoint (final plateau) in a normalized curve
    # Clamp to 100% maximum to prevent nonsensical values from fitting instabilities
    mobile_fraction = min(endpoint * 100, 100.0) if np.isfinite(endpoint) else np.nan
    
    features.update({
        'mobile_fraction': mobile_fraction,  # ← Now clamped to ≤ 100%
        ...
    })
```

## Technical Details

### The Formula

For all models:
```python
mobile_fraction = min(endpoint * 100, 100.0)
```

This ensures:
- ✅ If `endpoint ≤ 1.0`: Mobile fraction = `endpoint * 100` (correct value)
- ✅ If `endpoint > 1.0`: Mobile fraction = `100.0` (clamped to physical maximum)
- ✅ If `endpoint` is NaN/Inf: Mobile fraction = `NaN` (invalid data)

### Why Clamping is Correct

In a properly normalized FRAP curve:
- Pre-bleach intensity = 1.0 (normalized)
- Post-bleach intensity ≈ 0.0
- Maximum possible recovery = 1.0 (100%)

**Physical Reality:**
- Mobile fraction = (Recovered intensity) / (Pre-bleach intensity)
- Since pre-bleach = 1.0, mobile fraction = recovered intensity
- Recovered intensity cannot exceed 1.0 (you can't recover more than you started with!)
- **Therefore:** Mobile fraction ≤ 100%

The clamping corrects for fitting artifacts while preserving physically valid results.

## Impact on Results

### Before Fix
```
Analysis Results:
  Mobile Fraction: 112.3%  ← WRONG
  Immobile Fraction: -12.3%  ← WRONG
  Rate Constant: 0.234 s⁻¹
```

### After Fix
```
Analysis Results:
  Mobile Fraction: 100.0%  ← CORRECT (clamped)
  Immobile Fraction: 0.0%  ← CORRECT
  Rate Constant: 0.234 s⁻¹
```

### Interpretation
If mobile fraction is clamped to 100%, this indicates:
1. The curve fit suggests complete recovery
2. The fitting may have been affected by noise
3. Consider the quality metrics (R², AIC, BIC) to assess fit quality

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Normal Data
```python
# Should produce mobile fraction < 100%
A = 0.6, k = 0.3, C = 0.2
endpoint = 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8
mobile_fraction = 0.8 * 100 = 80%  ← PASS
```

### Test Case 2: Overshoot Due to Noise
```python
# Should clamp to 100%
A = 0.75, k = 0.3, C = 0.35
endpoint = 0.75 + 0.35 = 1.10
mobile_fraction = min(1.10 * 100, 100) = 100%  ← PASS (clamped)
```

### Test Case 3: Invalid Data
```python
# Should return NaN
A = NaN, k = 0.3, C = 0.2
endpoint = NaN
mobile_fraction = NaN  ← PASS
```

## Additional Considerations

### Should We Constrain the Fitting Instead?

**Option 1 (Current Fix):** Clamp mobile fraction after fitting
- ✅ Pros: Simple, preserves all fitted parameters, transparent
- ⚠️ Cons: Doesn't prevent overfitting, just corrects results

**Option 2 (Alternative):** Add bounds to curve fitting
```python
# In fit_all_models(), add bounds:
bounds = ([0, 0, 0], [1, np.inf, 1])  # A ≤ 1, C ≤ 1, so A+C ≤ 2 (but want ≤ 1)
```
- ✅ Pros: Prevents invalid fits entirely
- ⚠️ Cons: May reduce fit quality, more complex, harder to debug

**Recommendation:** The current clamping approach is preferred because:
1. It's transparent (user can see endpoint > 1 in raw parameters)
2. It doesn't interfere with the fitting algorithm
3. It's simple to understand and maintain
4. It provides correct output without breaking existing analyses

## Conclusion

✅ **Mobile fraction is now guaranteed to be ≤ 100%**  
✅ **Immobile fraction is now guaranteed to be ≥ 0%**  
✅ **Physically impossible values are eliminated**  
✅ **All three model types are corrected**

The fix maintains backward compatibility while ensuring biologically meaningful results.
