# Multi-Group Analysis UI Reorganization Summary

## Overview

The multi-group comparison interface has been reorganized to **prioritize mean recovery curve analysis** while making individual cell analysis available as an advanced option. This change reflects best practices in FRAP analysis and improves user workflow.

## Key Changes

### Before Reorganization

The multi-group comparison tab presented multiple analysis options without clear guidance:
- Population distribution analysis
- Statistical comparisons
- Averaged recovery profiles (buried deep in the interface)
- No advanced curve fitting integration
- Unclear when to use population vs. profile analysis

### After Reorganization

The interface now follows a logical, prioritized workflow:

#### **1. Mean Recovery Curve Analysis (PRIMARY)**
- **Displayed first** as the recommended approach
- Shows averaged recovery profiles for all selected groups
- Provides quantitative similarity metrics (max difference, RMSD, etc.)
- **Advanced Curve Fitting option** (expandable section):
  - Fit sophisticated biophysical models (anomalous diffusion, reaction-diffusion)
  - Extract mechanistic parameters
  - Compare fitted parameters between groups
  - Generate biological interpretations

#### **2. Population-Based Analysis (SECONDARY)**
- Analyzes distributions of kinetic parameters across cell populations
- Shows kinetic subpopulations (diffusion/intermediate/binding regimes)
- Population shift analysis (pairwise comparisons)
- Weighted kinetics calculations

#### **3. Individual Cell Analysis (OPTIONAL - Future)**
- Will be moved to expandable section for advanced users
- Focus on detailed cell-level exploration
- Best suited for exploring heterogeneity within a single condition

## Rationale for Prioritizing Mean Recovery Curves

### Advantages of Mean Curve Analysis

✅ **Higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio**
- Averaging across cells reduces measurement noise
- Enables fitting of sophisticated biophysical models
- More reliable parameter estimation

✅ **Mechanistic Insights**
- Can fit complex models (anomalous diffusion, reaction-diffusion)
- Extract biophysical parameters (diffusion coefficients, binding rates)
- Reveals underlying biological mechanisms

✅ **Robust Comparisons**
- Less sensitive to outliers and individual cell variability
- Population-level insights into treatment effects
- Direct visual comparison of recovery dynamics

### Limitations of Individual Cell Fitting

❌ **Lower SNR** → Can only fit simple exponential models
❌ **High Variability** → Requires larger sample sizes for reliable comparisons
❌ **Limited Mechanistic Insight** → Simple models don't reveal biophysical details

### When to Use Each Approach

| Use Case | Recommended Analysis |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Compare treatment effects on recovery dynamics** | Mean Recovery Curves |
| **Extract biophysical parameters (D, k_on, k_off)** | Advanced Fitting on Mean Curves |
| **Understand population heterogeneity within a group** | Individual Cell Analysis (Tab 1) |
| **Detect shifts in kinetic populations** | Population-Based Analysis |
| **Compare specific cells or subpopulations** | Individual Cell Analysis (Tab 1) |

## User Workflow

### Recommended Multi-Group Analysis Workflow

1. **Start with Mean Recovery Curves**
   - Load and select 2+ experimental groups
   - View averaged recovery profiles comparison
   - Assess visual differences and quantitative metrics

2. **Apply Advanced Fitting (Optional)**
   - Expand "Advanced Curve Fitting" section
   - Select biophysical model (or use "auto" for best AIC)
   - Click "Fit Advanced Models to Mean Curves"
   - Review fitted parameters and biological interpretation

3. **Explore Population Distributions**
   - Check if groups differ in kinetic subpopulations
   - Analyze population shifts (e.g., lost binding capability)
   - Review weighted kinetics

4. **Deep-Dive into Individual Conditions**
   - Switch to **Individual Group Analysis (Tab 1)**
   - Explore cell-level heterogeneity
   - Examine distributions of parameters
   - Perform outlier detection
