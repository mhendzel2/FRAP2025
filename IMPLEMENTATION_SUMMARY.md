# UI Reorganization: Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `streamlit_frap_final_clean.py` (Tab 2: Multi-Group Comparison section)

### Reorganization Structure

The Multi-Group Comparison tab has been completely reorganized to follow a logical, user-friendly workflow:

#### **NEW STRUCTURE:**

## Specific Code Changes

### 1. Header & Guidance (Lines ~2548-2590)

**Before:**
```python
st.markdown("## 🔬 Holistic Group Comparison")
# Buried explanation in expander
```

**After:**
```python
st.markdown("## 🔬 Multi-Group Comparison")
st.markdown("""
**Compare recovery dynamics across experimental conditions using mean recovery curves.**
...
💡 **Recommended Workflow:**
- Start here for comparing treatment conditions
- Use Individual Group Analysis (Tab 1) for cell-level analysis
""")
```

**Impact:** Clear guidance on when to use this tab vs. Tab 1

---

### 2. Section Order (Lines ~2600-2900)

**Before:**
```
1. Group selection
2. Population distribution table
3. Statistical comparison
4. Averaged profiles (at the end)
```

**After:**
```
1. Group selection
2. MEAN RECOVERY CURVES (first!)
3. Advanced curve fitting (integrated)
4. Population-based analysis (second)
5. Statistical comparison (within population section)
```

**Impact:** Users see the most robust analysis method first

---

### 3. Advanced Fitting Integration (Lines ~2742-2865)

**NEW:** Complete integration of advanced curve fitting into the multi-group comparison workflow

```python
with st.expander("🔬 Advanced Curve Fitting (Mechanistic Models)", expanded=False):
    st.markdown("""
    **Fit sophisticated biophysical models to mean recovery curves**
    
    **Available Models:**
    - Anomalous Diffusion
    - Reaction-Diffusion (Simple)
    - Reaction-Diffusion (Full)
    """)
    
    # Model selection
    advanced_model = st.selectbox(...)
    fit_bleach_radius = st.number_input(...)
    
    if st.button("Fit Advanced Models to Mean Curves"):
        # Perform fitting
        fit_results = compare_groups_advanced_fitting(...)
        
        # Display results
        # - Fitted parameters
        # - Fold changes
        # - Interpretation
        # - Plots
```

**Impact:** 
- Seamless access to advanced biophysical modeling
- One-click fitting with rich output
- Educational content about model selection

---

### 4. Removed Duplicates

**Removed:**
- Duplicate "Averaged Recovery Profile Comparison" section (lines ~3040-3090)
- Redundant profile metrics calculation
- Duplicate imports

**Impact:** Cleaner code, faster execution, no confusion

---

### 5. Educational Expandable Sections

**Added:**
```python
with st.expander("📖 Why Focus on Mean Recovery Curves?", expanded=False):
    st.markdown("""
    ✅ Higher signal-to-noise ratio
    ✅ Sophisticated biophysical models
    ✅ Population-level insights
    ✅ Robust comparisons
    
    ❌ Individual cell fitting limitations
    
    **Example Use Cases:**
    - Mean Curves: "Does Drug X slow recovery?"
    - Individual Cells: "What is the distribution of rates?"
    """)
```

**Impact:** Users understand why they should use each approach
