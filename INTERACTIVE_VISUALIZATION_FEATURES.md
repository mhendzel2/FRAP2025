## Date: October 19, 2025

---

## Overview

Two major interactive visualization enhancements have been added to the FRAP Analysis Platform:

1. **Interactive Parameter Dashboard** - Linked scatter plot exploration in Group Analysis
2. **Comprehensive Multi-Panel Plots** - Integrated view of recovery curves, residuals, and components

---

## Feature 1: Interactive Parameter Dashboard

### Location
**Tab 2: Group Analysis → Step 5: Interactive Parameter Dashboard**

### Description
An interactive scatter plot that links parameter space exploration with individual recovery curves. Users can click on any point in the scatter plot to instantly view the corresponding FRAP recovery curve.

### How It Works

1. **Select Parameters**: Choose X and Y axes from any numeric parameter (mobile fraction, half-time, rate constants, etc.)

2. **Explore the Scatter Plot**: 
   - Hover over points to see file names and parameter values
   - Points are color-coded by Y-axis value using a viridis colorscale
   - Click on points to select them

3. **View Recovery Curves**: 
   - Selected cells' recovery curves appear below the scatter plot
   - Up to 10 curves shown simultaneously
   - Each curve retains its experimental data and fit

### Use Cases

#### Identify Outliers
```python
# Scenario: Mobile fraction vs. R²
- Most points cluster around mobile fraction = 80%, R² > 0.95
- Click on low R² points to see why the fit failed
- Inspect their recovery curves for data quality issues
```

#### Explore Subpopulations
```python
# Scenario: Fast rate vs. Slow rate (double exponential fits)
- Bimodal distribution visible in scatter plot
- Click on fast-rate cluster: see pure diffusion behavior
- Click on slow-rate cluster: see binding-dominated recovery
```

#### Investigate Interesting Cells
```python
# Scenario: Mobile fraction vs. Half-time
- Spot unusual combination (low mobile, fast recovery)
- Click to examine the actual recovery curve
- May reveal experimental artifacts or novel behavior
```

### Benefits

✅ **Intuitive Data Exploration** - Visual parameter space + direct curve inspection  
✅ **Rapid Outlier Investigation** - Instantly see why a cell looks different  
✅ **Subpopulation Discovery** - Identify clusters and examine their kinetics  
✅ **Quality Control** - Quickly spot problematic curves by parameter patterns  
✅ **No Manual Searching** - Click instead of searching through file lists  

### Technical Implementation

```python
# Streamlit integration
selected_points = st.plotly_chart(fig_scatter, use_container_width=True, 
                                  key="scatter_dashboard", on_select="rerun")

# Extract clicked points
if selected_points and 'selection' in selected_points:
    selected_indices = selected_points['selection']['points']
    
    for idx_info in selected_indices[:10]:  # Limit to 10 curves
        file_path = scatter_data.iloc[point_idx]['file_path']
        # Plot recovery curve...
```

### Example Workflow

**Investigate Variable Mobile Fractions:**

1. Set X-axis = "mobile_fraction", Y-axis = "r2"
2. Notice some cells have mobile fraction > 95% while others are ~75%
3. Click on high mobile fraction points → see fast, complete recovery
4. Click on lower mobile fraction points → see persistent immobile population
5. Biological interpretation: Heterogeneity in chromatin binding states

## Feature 2: Comprehensive Multi-Panel Plots

### Location
**Tab 1: Single File Analysis → Comprehensive Analysis View**

### Description
A unified multi-panel visualization that combines:
- **Top Panel**: Recovery curve with fitted model
- **Middle Panel**: Residuals analysis
- **Bottom Panel**: Individual kinetic components (for multi-component fits)

### Structure

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Panel Details

#### Top Panel: Recovery Curve
- **Data Points**: Blue markers showing normalized intensity
- **Fit Line**: Red solid line showing model prediction
- **Annotation Box**: Shows:
  - Model type (Single/Double/Triple Exponential)
  - R² value (goodness of fit)
  - Mobile fraction (%)
  - Rate constants (k) and half-times (t½)
  - Component proportions (%)

#### Middle Panel: Residuals
- **Purpose**: Assess fit quality
- **Good Fit**: Random scatter around zero, no patterns
- **Poor Fit**: Systematic trends, waves, or clusters
- **Metrics**: Mean and standard deviation shown

#### Bottom Panel: Components (Multi-Component Fits Only)
- **Fast Component** (green): High k, rapid recovery
- **Medium Component** (orange): Intermediate k
- **Slow Component** (purple): Low k, binding-dominated
- **Baseline** (gray): Immobile fraction level
- **Each component labeled with its k value**

### When to Use

#### Quality Assessment
```
Q: Is my fit good?
A: Check residuals panel
   - Random scatter = good fit
   - Patterns = model inadequacy or data issues
```

#### Component Analysis
```
Q: Which component dominates recovery?
A: Check bottom panel
   - Larger amplitude = more important
   - Compare fast vs. slow contributions
```

#### Model Selection Validation
```
Q: Does my data really need a triple exponential?
A: Look at components panel
   - Are all three components distinct?
   - Or are two very similar (over-fitting)?
```

### Benefits

✅ **Holistic View** - See all analysis aspects in one plot  
✅ **Immediate Quality Check** - Residuals panel shows fit problems  
✅ **Component Understanding** - Visualize what each exponential contributes  
✅ **Publication Ready** - Professional multi-panel figure  
✅ **Space Efficient** - No need to scroll through separate plots  

### Technical Implementation

```python
# In frap_plots.py
@staticmethod
def plot_comprehensive_fit(time, intensity, fit_result, file_name="", height=800):
    """
    Create comprehensive multi-panel plot
    
    Returns:
    --------
    plotly.graph_objects.Figure with make_subplots
    """
    
    # Determine panel count based on model
    if model_type in ['double', 'triple']:
        n_rows = 3  # Recovery + Residuals + Components
    else:
        n_rows = 2  # Recovery + Residuals
    
    # Create subplot structure
    fig = make_subplots(
        rows=n_rows, cols=1,
        row_heights=[0.5, 0.25, 0.25] if n_rows == 3 else [0.7, 0.3],
        subplot_titles=["Recovery Curve with Fit", "Residuals", "Individual Components"],
        vertical_spacing=0.08
    )
    
    # Panel 1: Recovery curve
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=time, y=intensity, mode='markers', name='Data'), row=1, col=1)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=t_fit, y=y_fit, mode='lines', name='Fit'), row=1, col=1)
    
    # Panel 2: Residuals
    residuals = intensity - model(time, *params)
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=time, y=residuals, mode='markers', name='Residuals'), row=2, col=1)
    
    # Panel 3: Components (if multi-component)
    if model_type in ['double', 'triple']:
        for component in components:
            fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=t_fit, y=component, mode='lines', name=f'Comp k={k:.4f}'), row=3, col=1)
    
    return fig
```

### Example Use Cases

**Case 1: Validating Double Exponential Fit**
```
Scenario: Fitted with double exponential, want to verify it's justified

Steps:
1. Click "Show Comprehensive Analysis Plot"
2. Check middle panel (residuals):
   - Random scatter = good
   - If wavy pattern = might need triple exponential
3. Check bottom panel (components):
   - Are fast and slow clearly separated?
   - Do they both contribute significantly?
```

**Case 2: Troubleshooting Poor Fit**
```
Scenario: Low R² value, need to understand why

Steps:
1. View comprehensive plot
2. Residuals panel shows:
   - Large positive residuals at early times = model misses initial recovery
   - Large negative residuals at late times = model overestimates plateau
3. Interpretation: May need different model or check data quality
```

**Case 3: Understanding Biological Mechanism**
```
Scenario: Want to know if fast or slow component dominates

Steps:
1. View components panel
2. See that:
   - Fast component (green): 20% amplitude, k=1.2 s⁻¹
   - Slow component (purple): 80% amplitude, k=0.05 s⁻¹
3. Interpretation: Protein is primarily binding (80%), with minor diffusion (20%)
```

## User Guide

### Best Practices

#### For Parameter Dashboard
1. **Start with mobile fraction vs. R²** - Good for quality control
2. **Try rate constants vs. each other** - Identify kinetic regimes
3. **Check half-times vs. amplitudes** - Understand component importance
4. **Click clusters not individual points** - Find subpopulations
5. **Limit to 10 curves at once** - Avoid visual overload

#### For Comprehensive Plots
1. **Always check residuals first** - Random scatter = good fit
2. **Look for systematic patterns** - Indicates model problems
3. **Compare component amplitudes** - Which dominates recovery?
4. **Verify component separation** - Are they distinct or overlapping?
5. **Use for publication figures** - Professional multi-panel format

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Scatter plot not responding to clicks**
A: Make sure you're clicking directly on the data points (not empty space)

**Q: Too many recovery curves displayed**
A: Only the first 10 selected points are shown. Deselect and reselect fewer points.

**Q: Comprehensive plot button does nothing**
A: Check that file has been successfully fitted. Must have valid fit_result in file_data.

**Q: Components panel is missing**
A: Only shown for double/triple exponential fits. Single exponential has no separate components.
