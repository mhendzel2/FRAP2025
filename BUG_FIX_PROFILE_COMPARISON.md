# Bug Fix Summary - Profile Comparison Metrics Error

## Date
December 2024

## Overview
Fixed a critical error in the holistic group comparison feature where profile comparison metrics could not be displayed due to missing calculations and incorrect key access patterns.

---

## Error Description

### Error Message
```
Could not compute profile comparison metrics: 'max_difference'
```

### Location
**File:** `streamlit_frap_final_clean.py`  
**Line:** 2810 (accessing metrics)  
**Error Type:** KeyError

### User Impact
Users could not view profile comparison metrics when comparing recovery curves between two groups, causing the holistic comparison feature to fail with a warning message.

---

## Root Causes

### Cause 1: Missing Metric Calculations
The `compare_recovery_profiles()` function in `frap_group_comparison.py` was incomplete. It calculated `max_difference` and `max_difference_time`, but was missing:
- `mean_difference`: Average absolute difference across all time points
- `rmsd`: Root mean square deviation between profiles

### Cause 2: Incorrect Key Access Pattern
The UI code was trying to access metrics directly from the top level of the result dictionary:
```python
profile_comparison['max_difference']
```

But the function returns metrics nested under a `'comparison'` key:
```python
profile_comparison['comparison']['max_difference']
```

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Complete Metric Calculations

**File:** `frap_group_comparison.py`  
**Function:** `compare_recovery_profiles()` (lines ~535-565)

**Added calculations:**
```python
# Compute differences
if len(i1_common) > 0 and len(i2_common) > 0:
    intensity_diff = i2_common - i1_common
    max_diff = np.max(np.abs(intensity_diff))
    max_diff_time = t_common[np.argmax(np.abs(intensity_diff))]
    mean_diff = np.mean(np.abs(intensity_diff))  # NEW
    rmsd = np.sqrt(np.mean(intensity_diff**2))   # NEW
else:
    intensity_diff = np.array([])
    max_diff = np.nan
    max_diff_time = np.nan
    mean_diff = np.nan   # NEW
    rmsd = np.nan        # NEW
```

**Updated return structure:**
```python
'comparison': {
    'time_common': t_common,
    'intensity_diff': intensity_diff,
    'max_difference': max_diff,
    'max_difference_time': max_diff_time,
    'mean_difference': mean_diff,  # NEW
    'rmsd': rmsd                    # NEW
}
```

### Fix 2: Correct Key Access Pattern

**File:** `streamlit_frap_final_clean.py`  
**Lines:** 2803-2830 (updated)

**Before:**
```python
st.metric(
    "Max Difference",
    f"{profile_comparison['max_difference']:.3f}",  # WRONG
    help="Maximum absolute difference between averaged profiles"
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Fix: Access metrics from 'comparison' sub-dictionary
comparison_metrics = profile_comparison['comparison']

st.metric(
    "Max Difference",
    f"{comparison_metrics['max_difference']:.3f}",  # CORRECT
    help="Maximum absolute difference between averaged profiles"
)
```

---

## Metric Definitions

### Max Difference
**Formula:** `max(|intensity_group2 - intensity_group1|)`  
**Meaning:** The largest absolute difference between the two averaged recovery profiles at any time point  
**Use:** Identifies the point of maximum divergence between groups

### Mean Difference
**Formula:** `mean(|intensity_group2 - intensity_group1|)`  
**Meaning:** Average absolute difference across all time points  
**Use:** Overall measure of how different the profiles are

### RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)
**Formula:** `sqrt(mean((intensity_group2 - intensity_group1)²))`  
**Meaning:** Weighted measure of profile differences (emphasizes large deviations)  
**Use:** Statistical measure of profile similarity

---

## Technical Details

### Return Structure
The `compare_recovery_profiles()` function now returns:
```python
{
    'group1_name': str,
    'group2_name': str,
    'group1_profile': {
        'time': ndarray,
        'intensity_mean': ndarray,
        'intensity_sem': ndarray,
        'n_cells': int
    },
    'group2_profile': {
        'time': ndarray,
        'intensity_mean': ndarray,
        'intensity_sem': ndarray,
        'n_cells': int
    },
    'comparison': {
        'time_common': ndarray,
        'intensity_diff': ndarray,
        'max_difference': float,
        'max_difference_time': float,
        'mean_difference': float,  # NEW
        'rmsd': float               # NEW
    }
}
```

### Algorithm
1. Compute average recovery profiles for each group
2. Create common time grid using `np.union1d()`
3. Interpolate both profiles to common grid
4. Calculate point-wise differences: `i2_common - i1_common`
5. Compute three summary metrics:
   - Max: Maximum absolute difference
   - Mean: Average absolute difference
   - RMSD: Root mean square of differences

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty data arrays → return `np.nan` for all metrics
- Different time grids → interpolation to common grid
- Unequal sample sizes → handled by averaging functions

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Basic Profile Comparison
1. Load multi-group FRAP data (minimum 2 groups)
2. Navigate to **Tab 2: Multi-Group Comparison**
3. Enable **"Show Profile Comparison"** checkbox
4. Select **2 groups** for comparison
5. Scroll to **"Profile Comparison Metrics"** section
6. Verify:
   - ✅ Three metrics display: Max Difference, Mean Difference, RMSD
   - ✅ All values are numeric (not NaN unless data is empty)
   - ✅ No error messages appear
   - ✅ Hover tooltips explain each metric

### Test Case 2: Similar Profiles
1. Compare two groups with very similar kinetics
2. Expected: All metrics should be small (<0.1)
3. RMSD should be slightly larger than mean difference

### Test Case 3: Different Profiles
1. Compare two groups with very different kinetics
2. Expected: Metrics should show clear differences
3. Max difference > mean difference (expected pattern)

### Test Case 4: Edge Cases
1. Try with groups having different numbers of cells
2. Try with groups having different time point sampling
3. Verify interpolation works correctly

❌ mean_difference and rmsd not calculated
```

### After Fix
```

## Related Features

### Profile Visualization
These metrics complement the averaged recovery profile plots that show:
- Group 1 mean ± SEM (solid line with shaded CI)
- Group 2 mean ± SEM (solid line with shaded CI)
- Visual overlay for direct comparison

### Statistical Comparison
Works alongside the statistical tests section that shows:
- Mobile fraction t-test
- Population distribution shifts
- Kinetics fold changes

### Biological Interpretation
The metrics help answer:
- **Max Difference:** "Where do the groups diverge most?"
- **Mean Difference:** "How different are they overall?"
- **RMSD:** "Is the difference statistically meaningful?"
